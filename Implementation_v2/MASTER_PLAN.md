# VoxRay AI v2.0 - Master Implementation Plan

**Version:** 5.0 ULTIMATE EDITION  
**Created:** 2025-01-31  
**Timeline:** 24 Days (21 core + 3 buffer)  
**For:** Google Antigravity IDE (Manual Agent Allocation)

---

## 🎯 Mission

Execute all "Eval #2" technical architecture enhancements while maintaining **100% backward compatibility** with the current production system (Netlify + Hugging Face Spaces).

## 🚀 Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Preparation (Before Starting Any Agent)

1. **Create Project Structure**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/voxray-ai
   mkdir -p Implementation_v2/{AGENTS,SHARED}
   mkdir -p shared_context
   Copy All Files
   ```

Copy all files from this package into Implementation_v2/
Review GETTING_STARTED.md first
Initialize Shared Context

Bash

cp Implementation_v2/SHARED/00_CTX_SYNC_TEMPLATE.md shared_context/CTX_SYNC.md
Step 2: Sequential Agent Execution
⚠️ CRITICAL: Start with AG-00 and DO NOT proceed until Quality Gate 0 passes

YAML

execution_order:
phase_0: - agent: AG-00
file: Implementation_v2/AGENTS/AG-00_MigrationLead.md
must_complete_before: "All other agents"
quality_gate: "Quality Gate 0 (100% pass required)"

phase_1: - agent: AG-01
file: Implementation_v2/AGENTS/AG-01_ModelArchitect.md
start_after: "AG-00 complete" - agent: AG-08
file: Implementation_v2/AGENTS/AG-08_QualityAssurance.md
start_with: "AG-01 (parallel)"

phase_1b: - agent: AG-02
file: Implementation_v2/AGENTS/AG-02_PipelineEngineer.md
start_after: "AG-01 complete"

phase_2: - agent: AG-03
file: Implementation_v2/AGENTS/AG-03_ClinicalIntegrator.md
start_after: "AG-00 complete"
parallel_with: "AG-01, AG-02"

phase_3: - agent: AG-04
file: Implementation_v2/AGENTS/AG-04_VoiceSpecialist.md
start_after: "AG-00 complete"

phase_4: - agent: AG-05
file: Implementation_v2/AGENTS/AG-05_DevOpsArchitect.md
start_after: "AG-00, AG-01 complete"

phase_6: - agent: AG-06
file: Implementation_v2/AGENTS/AG-06_FullStackDeveloper.md
start_after: "AG-01, AG-03, AG-04 complete"

phase_5: - agent: AG-07
file: Implementation_v2/AGENTS/AG-07_DataScientist.md
start_after: "AG-01, AG-02 complete"

phase_7: - agent: AG-09
file: Implementation_v2/AGENTS/AG-09_DocumentationLead.md
start_after: "All technical agents complete"
Step 3: Communication Protocol
All agents MUST:

Read Before Starting:

SHARED/01_MUST_PRESERVE.md - What NOT to break
SHARED/00_CTX_SYNC_TEMPLATE.md - How to coordinate
SHARED/02_QUALITY_GATES.md - Success criteria
Update After Each Task:

/shared_context/CTX_SYNC.md - Your status
/shared_context/[agent-name]\_status.json - Your outputs
Notify When:

You complete a task
You encounter a blocker
You make a breaking change
You need another agent's output
Step 4: Quality Gates
Each phase has a quality gate. No agent proceeds to next phase until gate passes.

See SHARED/02_QUALITY_GATES.md for full criteria.

📋 Daily Workflow Example
For Human Coordinator
Bash

# Morning: Check status

cat shared_context/CTX_SYNC.md

# Allocate next agent

# Example: Starting AG-01 after AG-00 completes

google-antigravity-cli start-agent \
 --role "ModelArchitect" \
 --instructions "Implementation_v2/AGENTS/AG-01_ModelArchitect.md" \
 --context "shared_context/"

# Afternoon: Check progress

cat shared_context/AG-01_status.json

# Evening: Run quality checks

python scripts/check_quality_gate.py --phase 1
For Agent (What You'll Do)
When you're allocated as an agent:

Open your instruction file

Implementation_v2/AGENTS/AG-XX_YourName.md
Read referenced shared files

Listed at top of your instruction file
Execute tasks sequentially

Each task has clear deliverables
Update CTX_SYNC.md

After each task completion
Run self-checks

Commands provided in your file
Mark complete

Update your status to "✅ Complete"
🎯 Success Criteria
The implementation is complete when:

✅ All 10 agents marked "Complete" in CTX_SYNC.md
✅ All 7 quality gates passed
✅ 100% backward compatibility tests passing
✅ All documentation complete
✅ Production deployment successful
📞 Support
Questions? Check SHARED/07_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
Blockers? Update CTX_SYNC.md with blocker status
Breaking Changes? Must notify all dependent agents
